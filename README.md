Welcome to the <a href="https://walteis.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Nerdy Things</a> map annex. Maps are created with QGIS, webmaps are created with QGIS2web as OpenLayers maps.  Plus the occasional Google Map.

At some point I'll also add data layers, likely in KML format.  If that's of interest, just let me know.
